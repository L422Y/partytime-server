# Partytime ðŸ¥³ Server
Partytime Server is a real-time server for for [partytime](https://github.com/l422y/partytime), an interactive party mode for Spotify. 
Users can send their votes to a Twilio number, and the server will update the playlist based on the votes received. 

This project is built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and the Twilio API.

## Features
* Real-time updates
* Supports multiple Spotify accounts
* Uses Twilio SMS for voting

* Node.js (v12 or higher)
* A Twilio account with a phone number capable of SMS
* A Spotify account 
* A running instance of [partytime](https://github.com/l422y/partytime)
* A public URL set up for your [Twilio SMS webhook](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/webhooks/sms-webhooks). 

If you're using a local development environment, you can use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a public URL for your local server.
